THANK YOU SO MUCH!*********************************The old review: the helmet came without a part- two fasteners are missing, therefore the visor doesn't stay on. When you go to open the visor it falls down.Overall, the helmet was tough to connect, the plastic clips are a bit tight, but doable.If the company sends the fasteners I will give 5 stars.Thank you.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-12 17:33:15"},{"user":"Tatiana","content":"The Astronaut Helmet has undoubtedly been the star gift of this Christmas in our household. Purchased for our space-obsessed 3-year-old, it has exceeded expectations and become an instant favorite.First and foremost, the fit is perfect for our toddler. Though slightly big, it adds to the charm, ensuring that he'll be able to enjoy his astronaut adventures for quite some time. The sturdy construction is noteworthy; made from good-quality plastic, the helmet withstood a few accidental falls to the floor without a scratch.What sets this helmet apart is the movable visor. The ability to open and close the visor adds an exciting element to pretend play. Our little astronaut had a blast imitating spacewalks, exploring \"alien planets,\" and engaging in all sorts of imaginative adventures with the easily adjustable visor.On Christmas day and beyond, our toddler had the helmet on non-stop. It quickly became an integral part of his playtime routine, bringing joy and excitement to his imaginative exploits. The Astronaut Helmet has not only sparked creativity but also proven to be durable and resilient.In conclusion, this helmet is an absolute winner for parents seeking an engaging and durable gift for space-loving toddlers.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-12-26 17:33:15"},{"user":"Mike H.","content":"I don't know why more \"reasonably good looking\" space helmets aren't available. It's a costume that never goes out of style - for kids AND adults! Most you find are a joke. This helmet is one of the best I have found, especially for the price. I bought it for $20.This helmet is obviously intended for kids but adults can wear it too. It's a tight fit but looks pretty good. There are multiple foam pieces on the inside that make it pretty comfortable.Some assembly is required. (Strong hint: Put the two halves together BEFORE attaching the visor. It is MUCH easier that way.) The instructions say it can be disassembled but I was not able to.The plastic seems to be vinyl (though there is no recycle symbol on or in it). The helmet material is around 1/10th of an inch thick and each part is injection-molded, not vacuum-formed like most others. I have a Star Wars storm trooper helmet of the same material and quality. This helmet will NOT fall apart on you.The visor opens with some effort but it stays open. There are small air vents where your chin goes. I guess they make talking with the visor closed a lot more understandable. I'm also sure the visor will fog up without some kind of fan setup, even with the vents. (Something to put in the backpack? Sounds like a fun project!)This will make a great costume piece and a fun display the rest of the time. I am very happy with it.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"4.0","date":"2020-08-02 17:33:15"},{"user":"Shopper in NY","content":"positives:It's a very good quality helmet.Fits my very tall 8 year old, and will for a few more years.negative:astronaut helmets are expensive! SMHAs others noted, it's difficult to put the 2 halves of the helmet together. There are several plastic tabs that require a lot of force, and it's difficult to align. HOWEVER, if you use long nosed pliers to pinch the tabs a bit together so they slide easier into the slots, it makes the task exponentially easier. I worked from one side to the other.Once the two halves are put together, it's a cinch to put the visor on.Overall, I recommend if you don't mind the price... just put it together the day before.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-10-30 17:33:15"},{"user":"Amanda","content":"My son was excited for this helmet to go with his astronaut costume. It comes in 3 pieces and you snap it together. However, the visor on ours would not snap in place. One side snapped in just fine, but the other side kept popping out. We tried several times to get it to stay but it just wouldn't snap in. My son was disappointed and ended up not using the helmet since it wouldn't stay together. Other than that, he said the helmet was comfortable and had extra room.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"3.0","date":"2024-11-01 17:33:15"},{"user":"Jupiter M.","content":"Pros:Was sterdier than I expected. Originally thought the helmet would be flimsy. Though the face hole plastic does feel like it can be easily broken, but that's to be expected simce that area is thinerDidn't think there would be padding on the inside, but was pleasantly surprised to find padded foam in key areas of the head that needed it. Though I'm glad it's not overly filled with foam since it can get extremely sweatyCons:difficult to assemble. Took one adult and two teens to somehow jam the peices togetherIf you're an adult looking for a cosplay helmet this might not fit you. I'm 5'2 and could fit my head in just fine without my glasses. Though I recommend going in with the sheild already placed up.Again for adult mainly. You may get hot wearing it for long periods and have a slight hard time breathing due to the heat produced from your breathing. For a child this shouldn't be a problem though since it fits younger kids quite lose.The sheild can get a little jammed when trying to push it up. Had a few scares where I thought I was close to breaking it.Someone already mentioned this in another review and posted a picture, but there is a slight gap between the two peices of the helmet. Though i doesn't feel that noticeable for me at least.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-09-27 17:33:15"},{"user":"Justin","content":"This is one of the worst products I\u2019ve bought off Amazon. The helmet was extremely difficult to assemble, mainly because the little clips do not easily pop in, I had to use a pair of pliers to finally get it to snap together. And there\u2019s a piece that\u2019s supposed to hold the screen in place, but that keeps popping off (imagine how convenient that\u2019ll be at night when trick or treating!).Also, the American flag decal started peeling off only minutes after taking the pieces out of the box.What I especially don\u2019t understand about this product is why it comes in so many pieces in the first place.
